Midnight Mist landing
=====================

This is a minimal Bootstrap 5 landing page with the "Midnight Mist" radial-gradient background.

How to open locally:

1. Open `web-landing/index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open).
2. Or serve the folder with a static server, for example with Python:

```powershell
# from repo root
python -m http.server 8081 --directory .\web-landing
# then open http://localhost:8081
```

You can copy the files into your existing web folder or mount them in your Express app.
